# History of R

## R Programming

R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computations, data cleaning, data analysis, and graphical representation of data. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis.

In the year `2020`, the R community celebrated the 20th year of R version `1.0.0`. The current version of R programming is `4.1.0` with the nickname *Camp Pontanezen*.

## History of R

R has released so many versions and you can see their list by using:

```{r}
#| eval: false

rversions::r_versions()
```

Please note that you will need to install `rversions` package before `rversions::r_versions()` can work.
