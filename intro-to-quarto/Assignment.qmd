You have been provided with the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which includes detailed information on customer demographics, account details, subscribed services, and churn behaviour. Your task is to leverage your R skills to transform, analyse, and visualise this data, generating actionable insights. Synthesize your findings into a concise report to communicate key patterns, trends, and recommendations.

### Dataset Overview {.unnumbered}

The Telco Customer Churn dataset provides comprehensive details about customers, including their demographics, account information, service usage, and whether they have churned. Key columns include:

- **customerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.

- **gender**: Customer gender ('Male' or 'Female').

- **SeniorCitizen**: Indicator if the customer is a senior (1 for Yes, 0 for No).

- **Partner**: Whether the customer has a partner ('Yes' or 'No').

- **Dependents**: Whether the customer has dependents ('Yes' or 'No').

- **tenure**: Number of months the customer has stayed with the company.

- **PhoneService**: Indicates if the customer has a phone service ('Yes' or 'No').

- **MultipleLines**: Indicates if the customer has multiple phone lines ('Yes', 'No', or 'No phone service').

- **InternetService**: Type of internet service ('DSL', 'Fiber optic', or 'No').

- **OnlineSecurity**, **OnlineBackup**, **DeviceProtection**, **TechSupport**, **StreamingTV**, **StreamingMovies**: Service-specific columns with values ('Yes', 'No', or 'No internet service').

- **Contract**: Customer’s contract type ('Month-to-month', 'One year', or 'Two year').

- **PaperlessBilling**: Whether the customer uses paperless billing ('Yes' or 'No').

- **PaymentMethod**: Customer’s payment method (e.g., 'Electronic check', 'Mailed check', 'Bank transfer (automatic)', 'Credit card (automatic)').

- **MonthlyCharges**: Amount charged to the customer monthly.

- **TotalCharges**: Total amount charged to the customer.

- **Churn**: Indicates whether the customer has churned ('Yes' or 'No').

### Tasks {.unnumbered}

1. **Data Manipulation and Transformation**

   a. **Data Import:**  
      - Locate the `telco-customer-churn.csv` dataset at <https://bit.ly/telco-customer-churn> and import it into R.
      
   b. **Variable Transformation:**  
      - Transform the `Churn` column into a binary format (e.g., `1` for churned, `0` for not churned).
      
      - Recode the `SeniorCitizen` variable into a more descriptive format (e.g., "Yes" for 1 and "No" for 0).  
      - Create a new variable, such as `AvgChargePerMonth`, calculated by dividing `TotalCharges` by `tenure` (ensuring that cases where `tenure` is 0 are handled appropriately).  
      
      - Optionally, develop another metric (e.g., a `ServiceCount` that aggregates the number of additional services to which a customer subscribes).

2. **Handling Missing and Inconsistent Values**

   a. **Identify Issues:**  
      - Scan the dataset for missing or inconsistent values, and document which columns are affected. 

   b. **Data Quality Improvement:**  
      - Apply strategies to address any data quality issues (for example, convert data types if necessary, handle missing values, and ensure consistency across columns).

3. **Analysis and Insights**

   a. **Overall Churn Patterns:**  
      - Determine the overall churn rate in the dataset.
   
   b. **Segmented Analysis:**  
      - Calculate the percentage of churned customers across different segments such as:
       
        - **Gender:** What proportion of male vs. female customers churn?  
       
        - **Contract Type:** How does the churn rate vary across different contract types?  
       
        - **Internet Service:** What are the churn rates for customers with DSL, Fiber optic, or no internet service?
      
      - For each segment (or combination of segments), compute summary statistics (e.g., counts, averages, medians) for key metrics like `MonthlyCharges` and `tenure`.

   c. **Advanced Aggregation:**  
      - For each gender, determine summary statistics (mean, median, maximum) for monthly charges.
    
      - Identify which customer segment or service bundle is associated with the highest churn rate.

4. **Data Visualization**

   a. **Exploratory Visualizations:**  
      - Create a histogram or density plot to visualize the distribution of customer `tenure`.  
  
      - Develop a bar chart that shows the counts of churned and non-churned customers.

   b. **Comparative Visualizations:**  
      - Construct a boxplot to compare `MonthlyCharges` across different `Contract` types.
  
      - Generate a scatter plot displaying the relationship between `tenure` and `MonthlyCharges`, with points colored by churn status. Consider adding a trend line if it enhances interpretation.

   c. **Combined Analysis:**  
      - Filter the dataset to focus on a specific segment (for example, only customers with 'Fiber optic' service) and create additional visualizations (such as a histogram of their `tenure` or a scatter plot of their charges vs. tenure).
  
      - For each unique `tenure` value, compute the percentage of customers who churned, and plot these percentages as a line graph.


### Deliverables {.unnumbered}
